# My journey learning React.js

## Background info

- I wish to develope a basic understanding of **React.js** and **Next.js**, which I will use to make a prototype website for my school project.
- I'm somewhat proficient at Python, hence, I can understand Javascript to a certain extent – I can read and understand plain Javascript.
- I've experience with 3 other methods of web development: ***Wix.com, bubble.io, and Python flask***

## Material recommendations
- Brief/concise introduction: [***React in 100 Seconds***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM) by [**Fireship**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) – I highly recommend videos by Fireship for people who can't bother to read documentations
- Hands-on approach: [***Intro to React***](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) by [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org)

## What to expect

- I plan to follow the tutorial on [**React.js**'s website](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to get a general idea of how the framework works.
- I'll also have a demo website to play around with what I learnt (to be added).
