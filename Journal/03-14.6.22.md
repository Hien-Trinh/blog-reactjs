### 3rd day of React.js

- Didn't do much today â€“ mainly playing video games.
- Followed a course on Skillshare about React.js that does a search engine with API.
- FYI, I got free 1 month Skillshare from a Youtuber's sponser content so might as well use it.
- The course is [React for Beginners: Build an App, and Learn the Fundamentals](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/React-for-Beginners-Build-an-App-and-Learn-the-Fundamentals/365381517/projects?via=search-layout-grid) by Ryan Johnson
