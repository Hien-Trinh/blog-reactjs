### First day into Reactjs...

- Half of the day up until 13:00, I had obligations.
- Finished the [Overview](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview) section from the tutorial.
- Spent 3 literal hours figuring out why I can't commit to Github repo, realised that it's all because of the hidden .git file.
- Shutdown
