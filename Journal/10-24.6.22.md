### Charity Search Project

- I got bored with reading docs and messing around with the demos so I went straight into building the website.
- At this point, I felt that I have the necessary basics to finish this project.
- It took me 3 hours scrapping some logic from previous demos and finally slapped together a decent-looking website.
- It was kinda tedious dealing with the Server-Side rendering stuffs or the "passing data around pages" stuffs because it wasn't in the demo so all I had was plain documents to read.
- In the end though, it was really awesome.
- I get that it looks extremely plain, and probably my codding practises isn't ideal, but I think that I did a good job.
- Congrats to myself.
