### First day of Nextjs

- I moved on to Nextjs as I'm somewhat confident in React, also because I want the core of my website to be Nextjs.
- Did a React course refresher on the [Nextjs website](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs).
- Learnt some basics for Nextjs.
- Created an app, following the tutorial.
